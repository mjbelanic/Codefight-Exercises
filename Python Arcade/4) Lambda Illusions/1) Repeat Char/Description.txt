To make debug output more understandable, you often separate sets of logs by a single line of the same character. Since you use this method very often, you'd like to write a function that would handle printing the separator.

Implement a function that, given a character ch and the number of times it should be repeated n, returns a string of n characters ch.

Example

For ch = '*' and n = 20, the output should be
repeatChar(ch, n) = "********************".

Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (py)
[input] char ch

The character that should be repeated.

[input] integer n

The number of times the given character should be repeated.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

[output] string

A string consisting of n characters ch.
