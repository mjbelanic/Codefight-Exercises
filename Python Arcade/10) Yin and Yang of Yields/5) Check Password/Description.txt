You're implementing a web application. Like most applications, yours also has the authorization function. Now you need to implement a server function that will check password attempts made by users. Since you expect heavy loads, the function should be able to accept a bunch of requests that will be sent simultaneously.

In order to validate your function, you want to test it locally. Given a list of attempts and the correct password, return the 1-based index of the first correct attempt, or -1 if there were none.

Example

For attempts = ["hello", "world", "I", "like", "coding"] and
password = "like", the output should be
checkPassword(attempts, password) = 4.

Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (py)
[input] array.string attempts

A list of password attempts.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ attempts.length ≤ 20,
1 ≤ attempts[i].length ≤ 20.

[input] string password

Correct password.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ password.length ≤ 20.

[output] integer

The 1-based index of the first correct password attempt, or -1 or there were none.
