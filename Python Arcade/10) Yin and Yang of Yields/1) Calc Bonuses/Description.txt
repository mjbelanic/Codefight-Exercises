You are working on a revolutionary video game. In this game the player will be able to collect several types of bonuses on each level, and his total score for the level is equal to the sum of the first n bonuses he collected. However, if he collects less than n bonuses, his score will be equal to 0.

Given the bonuses the player got, your task is to return his final score for the level.

Example

For bonuses = [4, 2, 4, 5] and n = 3,
the output should be
calcBonuses(bonuses, n) = 10.

4 + 2 + 4 = 10.

For bonuses = [4, 2, 4, 5] and n = 5,
the output should be
calcBonuses(bonuses, n) = 0.

The player has collected only 4 bonuses, so his final score is 0.
