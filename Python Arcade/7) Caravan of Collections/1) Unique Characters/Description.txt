You need to compress a large document that consists of a small number of different characters. To choose the best encoding algorithm, you would like to look closely at the characters that comprise this document.

Given a document, return an array of all unique characters that appear in it sorted by their ASCII codes.

Example

For document = "Todd told Tom to trot to the timber",
the output should be
uniqueCharacters(document) = [' ', 'T', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'm', 'o', 'r', 't'].

Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (py)
[input] string document

A string consisting of English letters, whitespace characters and punctuation marks.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ document.length ≤ 80.

[output] array.char

A sorted array of all the unique characters that appear in the document.
