As you may know, the range function in Python allows coders to iterate over elements from start to stop with the given step. Unfortunately it works only for integer values, and additional libraries should be used if a programmer wants to use float values.

CodeFights doesn't include third-party libraries, so you have to make do with the standard ones. Given float numbers start, stop and step, your task is to return a list of values from start to stop (including start and not including stop), evenly spaced by the step.

Values start, stop and step have at most 5 digits after the decimal point each.

Example

For start = -0.9, stop = 0.45 and step = 0.2,
the output should be
floatRange(start, stop, step) = [-0.9, -0.7, -0.5, -0.3, -0.1, 0.1, 0.3].

Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (py)
[input] float start

Guaranteed constraints:
-1000 ≤ start ≤ stop ≤ 1000.

[input] float stop

Guaranteed constraints:
-1000 ≤ start ≤ stop ≤ 1000.

[input] float step

Guaranteed constraints:
0 < step ≤ 1000.

[output] array.float

A list of values in range [start, stop), spaced by the step.
