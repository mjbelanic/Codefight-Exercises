Looks like your little brother doesn't want to remember the multiplication table! Instead he wants to play videogames all day long. To teach him a lesson you'd like to write a virus that will pop up in the middle of the game and disappear only when the brother correctly solves several math questions.

To begin with, you need to construct a multiplication table. Given an integer n, return the multiplication table of size n × n.

Example

For n = 5, the output should be

multiplicationTable(n) = [[1, 2,  3,  4,  5 ], 
                          [2, 4,  6,  8,  10], 
                          [3, 6,  9,  12, 15], 
                          [4, 8,  12, 16, 20], 
                          [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]]
Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (py)
[input] integer n

The size of the multiplication table.

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 30.

[output] array.array.integer

Multiplication table of size n × n, i.e. a square matrix that has value i * j at the intersection of the ith row and the jth column (both 1-based).
