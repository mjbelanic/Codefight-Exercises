Given two lists lst1 and lst2, your task is to return a list formed by the elements of lst1 followed by the elements of lst2.

Note: this is a bugfix task, which means that the function is already implemented but there is a bug in one of its lines. Your task is to find and fix it.

Example

For lst1 = [2, 2, 1] and lst2 = [10, 11], the output should be
listsConcatenation(lst1, lst2) = [2, 2, 1, 10, 11].

Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (py)
[input] array.integer lst1

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ lst1.length ≤ 20,
-106 ≤ lst1[i] ≤ 106.

[input] array.integer lst2

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ lst2.length ≤ 20,
-106 ≤ lst2[i] ≤ 106.

[output] array.integer
